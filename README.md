## Step 1: Planning the project
* Defining the problem statement
    *  Understand the project requirements
* Pre-requisites
    * Setup the Github repository for the project
    * Basic knowledge of how to write in Markdown: [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUBNt18RFbo "Markdown Crash Course")

## Step 2: Researching the Iris Flower Data Set

<p>The Iris Flower Data Set consists of 50 samples taken from three types of Irs flower: Setosa, Virginica and Versicolor. Four measurements were taken from each sample: Sepal length and width and Petal length and width. Based on the combination of these measurements, a linear discriminant model was developed to distinguish the three types of Iris flower from one another.<p>

## Step 3: Downloading the Iris Flower Data Set

<p>Find a suitable Iris Flower Data Set CSV file online and import using Python Pandas.

Issues to resolve included the following:
* CSV file found online was missing a header row which includes the column detail.
* Once imported to Pandas and written to a text file it truncates the data.
    * Display text in non-truncated form.
* Read modifed text file using Pandas and print full non-truncated version in Python editor.
<p>

## Step 4:Writing Analysis.py

1. Output a summary of each variable to a single text file. Write to a file named iris_variable_summary.txt using the .describe() method.

1. Save a Histogram of each variable to png files.

1. Output a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
